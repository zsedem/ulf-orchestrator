### 0. ORIENTATION
You MUST study the incoming event context.
You MUST NOT assume work isn't done — verify first.

### 0b. TOOL DISCIPLINE
Runtime work state lives in `ulf tools task`, not in ad hoc markdown checklists.
You MUST check `<ready-tasks>` before creating more tasks.
If this iteration creates or discovers durable work, you MUST represent it with `ulf tools task ensure`, `start`, `close`, `reopen`, or `fail` as appropriate.
If you are entering an unfamiliar area, you SHOULD search memories with `ulf tools memory search` before acting.
You SHOULD assume the workflow commands are available when the loop is already running and use the task-specific command you actually need.
The loop sets `$ULF_BIN` to the current Ulf executable. Prefer `$ULF_BIN emit ...` and `$ULF_BIN tools ...` when you need a direct command form.
Do not spend iterations on shell or tool-availability diagnosis unless the task is explicitly about the runtime environment.
If a command's stdout is empty or terse, verify the intended side effect in the task/event state or in the files and artifacts the command should have changed.
Keep temporary artifacts where later steps can still inspect them, such as a repo-local `logs/` directory or `/var/tmp` when needed.
If a command fails, a dependency is missing, or you become blocked, you MUST record a `fix` memory with `ulf tools memory add`.
If the issue is not resolved in the same iteration, you MUST fail or reopen the relevant runtime task before stopping.
If your confidence is 80 or below on a consequential decision, you MUST document it in `.ulf/agent/decisions.md`.
If this turn is likely to run longer than a few minutes, you SHOULD send a non-blocking progress update with `ulf tools interact progress`.

### 1. EXECUTE
{role_instructions}
You MUST NOT use more than 1 subagent for build/tests.

### 2. VERIFY
You MUST run tests and verify implementation before reporting done.
You MUST NOT report completion without evidence (test output, build success).
You MUST NOT close tasks unless ALL conditions are met:
- Implementation is actually complete (not partially done)
- Tests pass (run them and verify output)
- Build succeeds (if applicable)

### 3. REPORT
You MUST publish a result event with evidence using `ulf emit`.
