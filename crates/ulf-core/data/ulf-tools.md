# Ulf Tools

Quick reference for shared `ulf tools` commands used during orchestration.

## Interact Commands

```bash
ulf tools interact progress "message"
```

Send a non-blocking progress update via the configured RObot (Telegram).

## Skill Commands

```bash
ulf tools skill list
ulf tools skill load <name>
```

List available skills or load a specific skill by name.

## Wave Commands

Dispatch multiple events as a wave for parallel hat execution:

```bash
ulf wave emit <topic> --payloads "item1" "item2" "item3"
```

Each payload becomes a separate event tagged with a shared `wave_id`. The loop runner
detects wave events and spawns parallel backend instances (up to the hat's `concurrency` limit).

**When to use:** When a hat's configuration has `concurrency > 1`, use wave dispatch
to send N items for parallel processing instead of N sequential iterations.

**Constraints:**
- Cannot be used inside a wave worker (`ULF_WAVE_WORKER=1` blocks it)
- Wave workers emit results via `ulf emit`, not `ulf wave emit`

## Memory Commands

```bash
ulf tools memory add "content" -t pattern --tags tag1,tag2
ulf tools memory list [-t type] [--tags tags]
ulf tools memory search "query" [-t type] [--tags tags]
ulf tools memory prime --budget 2000    # Output for context injection
ulf tools memory show <mem-id>
ulf tools memory delete <mem-id>
```

**Memory types:**

| Type | Flag | Use For |
|------|------|---------|
| pattern | `-t pattern` | "Uses barrel exports", "API routes use kebab-case" |
| decision | `-t decision` | "Chose Postgres over SQLite for concurrent writes" |
| fix | `-t fix` | "ECONNREFUSED on :5432 means run docker-compose up" |
| context | `-t context` | "ulf-core is shared lib, ulf-cli is binary" |

**Memory ID format:** `mem-{timestamp}-{4hex}` (e.g., `mem-1737372000-a1b2`)

**NEVER use echo/cat to write tasks or memories** — always use CLI tools.

### When to Search Memories

**Search BEFORE starting work when:**
- Entering unfamiliar code area → `ulf tools memory search "area-name"`
- Encountering an error → `ulf tools memory search -t fix "error message"`
- Making architectural decisions → `ulf tools memory search -t decision "topic"`
- Something feels familiar → there might be a memory about it

**Search strategies:**
- Start broad, narrow with filters: `search "api"` → `search -t pattern --tags api`
- Check fixes first for errors: `search -t fix "ECONNREFUSED"`
- Review decisions before changing architecture: `search -t decision`

### When to Create Memories

**Create a memory when:**
- You discover how this codebase does things (pattern)
- You make or learn why an architectural choice was made (decision)
- You solve a problem that might recur (fix)
- You learn project-specific knowledge others need (context)
- Any non-zero command, missing dependency/skill, or blocked step (fix + task if unresolved)

**Do NOT create memories for:**
- Session-specific state (use tasks instead)
- Obvious/universal practices
- Temporary workarounds

### Failure Capture (Generic Rule)

If any command fails (non-zero exit), or you hit a missing dependency/skill, or you are blocked:
1. **Record a fix memory** with the exact command, error, and intended fix.
2. **Open or reopen a task** if it won't be resolved in the same iteration.

```bash
ulf tools memory add \
  "failure: cmd=<command>, exit=<code>, error=<message>, next=<intended fix>" \
  -t fix --tags tooling,error-handling

ulf tools task ensure "Fix: <short description>" --key fix:<short-key> -p 2
```

### Discover Available Tags

Before searching or adding, check what tags already exist:

```bash
ulf tools memory list
grep -o 'tags: [^|]*' .agent/memories.md | sort -u
```

Reuse existing tags for consistency. Common tag patterns:
- Component names: `api`, `auth`, `database`, `cli`
- Concerns: `testing`, `performance`, `error-handling`
- Tools: `docker`, `postgres`, `redis`

### Memory Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: "Uses barrel exports in each module" not "Has good patterns"
2. **Include why**: "Chose X because Y" not just "Uses X"
3. **One concept per memory**: Split complex learnings
4. **Tag consistently**: Reuse existing tags when possible

## Decision Journal

Use `.ulf/agent/decisions.md` to capture consequential decisions and their
confidence scores. Follow the template at the top of the file and keep IDs
sequential (DEC-001, DEC-002, ...).

Confidence thresholds:
- **>80**: Proceed autonomously.
- **50-80**: Proceed, but document the decision in `.ulf/agent/decisions.md`.
- **<50**: Choose the safest default and document the decision in `.ulf/agent/decisions.md`.

Template fields:
- Decision
- Chosen Option
- Confidence (0-100)
- Alternatives Considered
- Reasoning
- Reversibility
- Timestamp (UTC ISO 8601)

## Output Formats

All commands support `--format`:
- `table` (default) - Human-readable
- `json` - Machine-parseable
- `quiet` - IDs only (for scripting)
- `markdown` - Memory prime only

**NEVER use echo/cat to write tasks or memories** — always use CLI tools.
