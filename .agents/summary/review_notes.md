# Documentation Review Notes

## Consistency Check

### Cross-Document Consistency ✅

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Crate names and versions | ✅ Consistent | All crates at v2.6.0, npm at 2.3.0 |
| Architecture descriptions | ✅ Consistent | EventBus, hat system, and loop patterns described consistently |
| File path references | ✅ Consistent | All paths relative to workspace root |
| Terminology | ✅ Consistent | "Hat", "Topic", "Event", "HatlessUlf" used uniformly |
| Backend list | ✅ Consistent | Claude, Kiro, Gemini, Codex, Amp, Pi listed consistently |
| Configuration format | ✅ Consistent | v1/v2 normalization documented in architecture and data_models |

### Potential Ambiguities

1. **"Task" has dual meaning**: The word "task" refers to both runtime work tracking items (`Task` in `ulf-core/src/task.rs`) and code task files (`.code-task.md`). The CLI disambiguates: `ulf tools task` for runtime tasks, `ulf code-task` for code task generation.

2. **"Web" packages**: There are two web stacks — the Node.js legacy backend (`backend/ulf-web-server/`) and the new Rust API server (`crates/ulf-api/`). The Node.js backend uses tRPC/SQLite while the Rust API uses Axum. Both coexist.

## Completeness Check

### Well-Documented Areas ✅

- [x] Event-driven architecture and pub/sub patterns
- [x] Hat system (subscriptions, publications, routing priority)
- [x] Configuration model (v1/v2 format, validation, normalization)
- [x] JSON-RPC protocol (all commands and events documented)
- [x] Task and memory data models
- [x] Parallel loop coordination (worktrees, merge queue, lock)
- [x] Hook lifecycle system (phases, error modes, suspend)
- [x] Telegram human-in-the-loop integration
- [x] CLI command surface
- [x] Dependency inventory

### Areas With Limited Coverage

| Area | Gap | Recommendation |
|------|-----|----------------|
| **ulf-api routes** | Individual API endpoint signatures not fully enumerated | Read `crates/ulf-api/src/loop_domain.rs` etc. for specific routes |
| **Web dashboard pages** | React component props and state management not detailed | Read `frontend/ulf-web/src/pages/` for page-level implementation |
| **Node.js backend internals** | tRPC router procedures and SQLite schema not fully mapped | Read `backend/ulf-web-server/src/api/trpc.ts` and `db/schema.ts` |
| **Preset YAML schema** | Hat collection YAML structure (presets/) not formally documented | Read `presets/README.md` and `presets/COLLECTION.md` |
| **Diagnostics system** | Diagnostic collector modules listed but output format not detailed | Read `crates/ulf-core/src/diagnostics/` modules |
| **Skills system** | Skill frontmatter schema and discovery algorithm not detailed | Read `crates/ulf-core/src/skill.rs` and `skill_registry.rs` |

### Language Support Limitations

| Language | Support Level | Notes |
|----------|--------------|-------|
| Rust | ✅ Full | All 215 source files analyzed |
| TypeScript (Backend) | ⚠️ Structural | Module listing complete; internal APIs partially documented |
| TypeScript (Frontend) | ⚠️ Structural | Component listing complete; props/state not detailed |
| YAML (Presets) | ⚠️ Referenced | Preset files referenced but schema not formally documented |

## Recommendations

1. **No action needed for primary documentation** — architecture, components, interfaces, data models, and workflows are comprehensive for AI assistant context.

2. **Future enhancement**: Add detailed API route documentation for `ulf-api` if web dashboard development increases.

3. **Future enhancement**: Document the preset YAML schema formally if custom hat collection authoring becomes a common user activity.

4. **Future enhancement**: Add sequence diagrams for the web dashboard data flow (tRPC ↔ SQLite ↔ React) if the web UI becomes a primary interface.
