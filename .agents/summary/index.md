## Quick Reference

### Project Structure
- **9 Rust crates** in `crates/` (proto → core → adapters → cli/tui/telegram/api/e2e/bench)
- **1 Node.js backend** in `backend/ulf-web-server/` (Fastify + tRPC + SQLite)
- **1 React frontend** in `frontend/ulf-web/` (Vite + TailwindCSS)
- **Hat presets** in `presets/` (YAML configuration files)

### Key Concepts
- **Event Loop**: Core orchestration via pub/sub EventBus with topic-based routing
- **Hats**: Agent personas (Planner, Builder, custom) with subscriptions and publications
- **HatlessUlf**: Constant coordinator that builds prompts and delegates
- **Memories**: Persistent learning stored in markdown (`.ulf/agent/memories.md`)
- **Tasks**: Runtime work tracking in JSONL (`.ulf/agent/tasks.jsonl`)
- **Hooks**: Lifecycle event handlers (pre/post loop, iteration, completion)
- **Parallel Loops**: Concurrent execution via git worktrees with merge queue
- **RObot**: Human-in-the-loop via Telegram (blocking questions + proactive guidance)

### Backends Supported
Claude, Kiro, Gemini, Codex, Amp, Pi, and custom commands.

### Execution Modes
1. **Subprocess TUI** (default): Two-process model with ratatui frontend
2. **Autonomous** (`--no-tui`): Headless CLI execution
3. **RPC** (`--rpc`): JSON-lines protocol for IDE integration
4. **Web Dashboard**: React UI via ulf-api server
5. **Telegram Daemon**: Persistent bot for remote interaction

### Configuration
- Core config: `ulf.yml` (supports v1 flat and v2 nested formats)
- Hat collections: `presets/*.yml` or custom YAML via `-H` flag
- Split model: core config + hat collection merged at runtime
