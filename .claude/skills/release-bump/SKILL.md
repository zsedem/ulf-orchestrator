# Release Bump

## Overview

Bump version and trigger release for ulf-orchestrator. All versions live in workspace `Cargo.toml` - individual crates inherit via `version.workspace = true`.

Confirm the new version with the user. Once the bump commit is pushed, track progress of the release.

## Quick Reference

| Step | Command/Action |
|------|----------------|
| 1. Bump version | Edit `Cargo.toml`: replace all `version = "X.Y.Z"` (7 occurrences) |
| 2. Build | `cargo build` (updates Cargo.lock) |
| 3. Test | `cargo test` |
| 4. Commit | `git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock && git commit -m "chore: bump to vX.Y.Z"` |
| 5. Push | `git push origin main` |
| 6. Tag | `git tag vX.Y.Z && git push origin vX.Y.Z` |

## Version Locations (All in Cargo.toml)

```toml
# Line ~17 - workspace version
[workspace.package]
version = "X.Y.Z"

# Lines ~113-118 - internal crate dependencies
ulf-proto = { version = "X.Y.Z", path = "crates/ulf-proto" }
ulf-core = { version = "X.Y.Z", path = "crates/ulf-core" }
ulf-adapters = { version = "X.Y.Z", path = "crates/ulf-adapters" }
ulf-tui = { version = "X.Y.Z", path = "crates/ulf-tui" }
ulf-cli = { version = "X.Y.Z", path = "crates/ulf-cli" }
ulf-bench = { version = "X.Y.Z", path = "crates/ulf-bench" }
```

**Tip:** Use Edit tool with `replace_all: true` on `version = "OLD"` → `version = "NEW"` to update all 7 at once.

## What CI Does Automatically

Once you push the tag, `.github/workflows/release.yml` triggers and:

1. Creates the GitHub Release with auto-generated notes
2. Builds binaries for macOS (arm64, x64) and Linux (arm64, x64)
3. Uploads artifacts to the GitHub Release
4. Publishes to crates.io (in dependency order)
5. Publishes to npm as `@ulf-orchestrator/ulf`

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Only updating workspace.package.version | Must update all 7 occurrences including internal deps |
| Forgetting to run tests | Always `cargo test` before commit |
| Creating release manually with `gh release create` | Just push the tag - CI creates the release with artifacts |
| Pushing tag before main | Push main first, then push the tag |
