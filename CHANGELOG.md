# Changelog

All notable changes to ulf-orchestrator are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Claude child sessions now default to `--setting-sources project,local`, preventing host user-level `~/.claude/settings.json` hooks, plugins, and MCP servers from leaking into Ulf orchestration runs. Users who want the old behavior can opt back in with `cli.args: ["--setting-sources", "user,project,local"]`.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-04-10

### Changed

- Added a post-publish `cargo install` smoke test to the release workflow for faster detection of broken release artifacts.
- Expanded `ulf doctor` auth environment variable detection for the Pi and Roo backends.
- Documented the Pi backend in the backend guide.

### Fixed

- Fixed Claude + TUI blank/stuck output on large prompts by avoiding the PTY stdin deadlock in non-interactive PTY execution.

## [2.9.1] - 2026-04-04

### Fixed

- `cargo install ulf-cli` fails due to cross-crate `#[path]` include of `tool_preview.rs` from `ulf-adapters` into `ulf-tui`. Moved `tool_preview` to a public module in `ulf-adapters` and added it as a proper dependency.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-03

### Added

- Agent waves for intra-loop parallel hat execution.
- Current branch display in the TUI header.
- Richer Copilot JSON stream event handling.

### Changed

- Improved rich TUI tool output and the end-to-end harness.
- Shifted coverage and Rust gate validation earlier in CI, with aligned local/GitHub checks.
- Refreshed documentation links and coverage publishing plumbing.

### Fixed

- TUI mouse toggle behavior.
- Scratchpad path resolution for loop state.
- Large prompt handoff for arg-based backends by routing through temp files.
- CLI executor streaming and inactivity-timeout handling.
- Self-loop event publishing guidance and backend contract validation coverage.

## [2.8.1] - 2026-03-16

### Changed

- Version bump for 2.8.1 release.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added

- `ulf mcp serve` for exposing Ulf as a workspace-scoped MCP server over stdio.
- User-scoped default config discovery and support for per-user Ulf defaults.
- TUI update availability notices in the header.
- Human guidance can now trigger a clean restart request flow.

### Changed

- Consolidated the core preset set around the maintained workflows and refreshed preset docs, examples, and evaluation tooling.
- Refined PDD and code-task guidance to reduce Ulf-specific noise and improve handoff quality.

### Fixed

- Hardened multi-hat preset event contracts, late-event recovery, active hat display, and downstream debug/review handoffs.
- Preserved runtime limits from core config when using hats.
- Fixed headless loop runner backend selection.
- Made restart resumption use the required single-command shell flow and added contract coverage for it.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-03-06

### Added

- Per-project orchestrator lifecycle hooks v1.
- `kiro-acp` backend with ACP executor support.
- Subprocess TUI over JSON-RPC stdin/stdout.
- Improved TUI tool rendering for ACP-backed flows.

### Changed

- Simplified internal code paths by removing redundant clones and deduplicating `now_ts`.
- Replaced deprecated `Duration` method usage with `from_secs`.
- `ulf plan` PDD SOP now syncs from the canonical `strands-agents/agent-sop` upstream source, with a small Ulf-specific loop handoff addendum.
- Added embedded asset sync, check, and upstream refresh helpers for SOP maintenance.
- Unified and modernized preset documentation.
- Added `llms.txt` map generation and CI validation.
- Hardened web `tsx` preflight behavior and added funding metadata.

### Fixed

- Avoid self-lock contention in subprocess TUI mode.
- Accumulate Pi text deltas into flowing paragraphs in the TUI.
- Clean up zombie worktree loops more reliably.
- Fix ACP orphaned processes, garbled TUI output, and missing tool details.
- Resolve clippy issues and missing struct fields.

## [2.6.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Rust RPC v1 control plane and web client migration to the new RPC contract.
- Shell completions support for `ulf` CLI.
- `fresh-eyes` preset with enforced review passes.

### Fixed

- Hat display no longer gets stuck on the previous iteration's hat.
- UTF-8 safe truncation to prevent panics on multi-byte characters.
- Hat-level backend shorthand `args` is honored for custom hats (including OpenCode).
- Deprecated `project.*` config keys now fail fast with a clear migration hint to `core.*`.

## [2.5.1] - 2026-02-14

### Changed

- Version bump for 2.5.1 release.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-01-28

### Added

- **Web Dashboard (Alpha)**: Full-featured web UI for monitoring and managing Ulf orchestration loops
  - React + Vite + TailwindCSS frontend with Fastify + tRPC + SQLite backend
  - `ulf web` command to launch both servers (backend:3000, frontend:5173)
  - Preflight checks and auto-install for fresh installs
  - Port conflict detection, labeled output, and automatic browser open
  - Node 22 pinned for backend dev with tsc+node compilation
- **Hats CLI**: Topology visualization and AI-powered diagrams (`ulf hats`)
- **Event Publishing Guide**: Skip topology display when a hat is already active
- **Parallel config gate**: `features.parallel` config option to control worktree spawning
- **Per-hat backend args**: `args` support in hat-level backend configurations
- **New presets**: Additional presets and improved workflow patterns
- **Documentation**: Reorganized docs with governance files and enhanced README

### Fixed

- Honor hat-level backend configuration and args overrides
- Backend dev workflow uses tsc+node instead of ts-node

## [2.2.5] - 2025-01-17

- Config override support for core fields via CLI

## [2.2.3] - 2025-01-12

### Added

- Multi-loop concurrency via git worktrees
- OBJECTIVE section in prompts to prevent goal drift
