/**
 * LoopsManager Tests - Merge Button State API
 *
 * Tests for the merge button state API that exposes rust merge_button_state
 * to the TypeScript backend. These tests verify:
 * 1. getMergeButtonState returns active when primary loop is idle
 * 2. getMergeButtonState returns blocked with reason when primary is running
 * 3. Integration with tRPC router
