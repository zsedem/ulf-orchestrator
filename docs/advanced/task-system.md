# Task System

!!! note "Documentation In Progress"
    This page is under development. Check back soon for comprehensive task system documentation.

## Overview

Ulf's task system provides runtime work tracking through `.agent/tasks.jsonl`, replacing the legacy scratchpad mechanism.

## Task Lifecycle

1. **Created** - Task added to the queue
2. **In Progress** - Agent actively working
3. **Completed** - Task finished successfully
4. **Blocked** - Awaiting dependency or input

## Configuration

```yaml
tasks:
  enabled: true  # Default
  path: .agent/tasks.jsonl
```

## CLI Commands

```bash
ulf task list              # Show current tasks
ulf task add "description" # Add new task
ulf task complete <id>     # Mark task complete
```
