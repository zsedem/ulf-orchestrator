# TDD Workflow Example

!!! note "Documentation In Progress"
    This page is under development. Check back soon for a complete TDD workflow example.

## Overview

This example demonstrates using Ulf for Test-Driven Development workflows, where tests are written before implementation.

## Workflow

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Write Test] --> B[Run Tests - Fail]
    B --> C[Implement Code]
    C --> D[Run Tests - Pass]
    D --> E[Refactor]
    E --> A
```

## Configuration

```yaml
preset: tdd
hats:
  test-writer:
    triggers:
      - "write test"
  implementer:
    triggers:
      - "test:fail"
```
