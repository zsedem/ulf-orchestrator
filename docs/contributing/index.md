## Development Philosophy

Ulf follows the [Six Tenets](../concepts/tenets.md):

1. **Fresh Context Is Reliability**
2. **Backpressure Over Prescription**
3. **The Plan Is Disposable**
4. **Disk Is State, Git Is Memory**
5. **Steer With Signals, Not Scripts**
6. **Let Ulf Ulf**

Contributions should align with these principles.

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

From the Ulf philosophy:

- Building features into orchestrator that agents can handle
- Complex retry logic (fresh context handles recovery)
- Detailed step-by-step instructions (use backpressure instead)
- Scoping work at task selection time (scope at plan creation)
- Assuming functionality is missing without code verification

## Code of Conduct

Be respectful and constructive. We're all here to make Ulf better.
