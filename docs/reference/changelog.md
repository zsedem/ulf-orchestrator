# Changelog

All notable changes to Ulf Orchestrator will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Checkpoint Gates**: Mid-session backpressure scripts that run at iteration boundaries
  - `every_n_iterations` trigger: run every N iterations (e.g., every 5)
  - `after_event` trigger: run when a specific event topic is emitted (e.g., `dev.done`)
  - On failure, injects `task.resume` backpressure so the agent can fix issues early
  - Configured under `event_loop.checkpoint_gates` in `ulf.yml`
  - See `presets/checkpoint-lint.yml` for an example preset

### Fixed

- **Migration Docs**: Removed fictional `checkpoint_interval` field from v1→v2 migration guide
- **Configuration Guide**: Added `completion_gates` and `checkpoint_gates` to the event_loop reference

## [2.1.0] - 2026-01-20

### Added

- **TUI Iteration Architecture**: Refactored TUI to iteration-based model with snapshot testing
  - Each iteration gets its own buffer for clean separation
  - Iteration switcher (←/→ arrows) to review previous iterations
  - Snapshot-based testing for TUI components

### Fixed

- **TUI Content Display**: Removed ellipsis truncation that was cutting off content mid-word
  - Long lines now soft-wrap at viewport boundaries instead of being truncated with "..."
- **TUI Autoscroll**: Content now autoscrolls to keep latest output visible
- **TUI Artifacts**: Fixed viewport buffer clearing to prevent visual artifacts when switching iterations
- **Markdown Boundaries**: Preserved line boundaries when rendering markdown content
- **Backend Support**: Added `opencode` and `copilot` to valid backends for `ulf init` (#75, #77)
- **Interrupt Handling**: Fixed Ctrl+C race condition where process continued executing after interrupt (#76)

## [2.0.0] - 2026-01-14

### Added

- **Hatless Ulf Architecture**: Ulf is now a constant coordinator with optional hats
  - Solo mode: Ulf handles all events (no hats configured)
  - Multi-hat mode: Ulf orchestrates multiple specialized hats
  - Per-hat backend configuration (each hat can use different AI agent)
  - Default publishes: Hats can specify fallback events
- **JSONL Event Format**: Events written to `.ulf/events-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.jsonl` instead of XML in output
  - Each run creates unique timestamped events file for isolation
  - Structured event format: `{"topic":"...", "payload":"...", "ts":"..."}`
  - `ulf emit` command for safe event emission
  - EventReader for reading new events since last read
  - Backward compatible with existing event topics
- **Interactive TUI Mode**: Full-screen terminal UI for agent interaction
  - Embedded terminal widget with PTY integration
  - Prefix commands (Ctrl+a): quit, help, pause, skip, abort
  - Scroll mode with navigation (j/k/arrows/Page Up/Down/g/G)
  - Search in scroll mode (/ and ? for forward/backward, n/N for next/prev)
  - Iteration boundary handling (screen clears between iterations)
  - Configurable prefix key in ulf.yml
- **Mock Backend Testing**: Deterministic E2E testing with scripted responses
  - MockBackend for testing without real AI agents
  - Scenario YAML format for test cases
  - 5 scenario tests covering solo mode, multi-hat, orphaned events, default_publishes, mixed backends

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: No default hats - empty config = solo Ulf mode
- **BREAKING**: Planner hat removed from all presets
- **BREAKING**: Events must be written to `.ulf/` directory (XML format deprecated)
- **BREAKING**: HatRegistry no longer creates default planner/builder hats
- CLI flag `--tui` launches TUI mode for visual observation
- TUI mode provides scroll and search navigation while removing execution controls (pause, skip, abort)
- HatConfig now includes `backend` and `default_publishes` fields
- InstructionBuilder adds `build_hatless_ulf()` for new prompt format
- EventLoop uses EventReader instead of EventParser

### Removed

- **BREAKING**: XML event format no longer supported
- **BREAKING**: Automatic planner/builder hat creation

## Release Process

### 1. Pre-release Checklist

- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` updated
- [ ] Workspace version bumped in `Cargo.toml`
- [ ] npm package version bumped in `package.json`
- [ ] README/install examples tested
- [ ] Release workflow secrets and npm trusted publishing still configured

### 2. Release Steps

Ulf uses the tag-driven GitHub Actions workflow in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.
The release is created automatically by `cargo-dist`, then crates.io and npm publish jobs run.

```bash
# 1. Update release metadata
$EDITOR Cargo.toml
$EDITOR package.json
$EDITOR CHANGELOG.md

# 2. Validate locally
cargo test
cargo package -p ulf-cli --allow-dirty --list > /dev/null
npm test

# 3. Commit the release prep
git add Cargo.toml Cargo.lock package.json CHANGELOG.md README.md docs/
git commit -m "release: prepare vX.Y.Z"

# 4. Tag the release
git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "vX.Y.Z"

# 5. Push the branch and tag
git push origin main
git push origin vX.Y.Z

# 6. Monitor the release workflow
gh run watch --workflow Release

# 7. Verify published outputs
gh release view vX.Y.Z
cargo install ulf-cli --version X.Y.Z
npm view @ulf-orchestrator/ulf-cli version
```

### 3. What the automated workflow publishes

On a successful tag push, the release workflow will:

- build GitHub Release archives/installers with `cargo-dist`
- create the GitHub Release automatically
- publish workspace crates to crates.io in dependency order
- publish the npm package via trusted publishing

### 4. Post-release

- [ ] Smoke-test npm install
- [ ] Smoke-test Cargo install
- [ ] Smoke-test the GitHub Releases shell installer
- [ ] Announce the release
- [ ] Update any external package taps or mirrors
- [ ] Plan the next release
