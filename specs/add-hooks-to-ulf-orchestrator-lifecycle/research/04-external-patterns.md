# Research: External Hook + Pause/Resume Patterns

## Goal
Extract proven patterns from Claude Code hooks and CI/orchestration systems to reduce operator surprise in Ulf v1 hooks.

## Snapshot
Research verified against publicly available docs as of 2026-02-28.

## Findings

### 1) Explicit lifecycle phases reduce ambiguity
Across systems, users understand hooks best when phases are explicit (`pre`/`post`) and semantically scoped.

- Git hooks use named lifecycle boundaries (`pre-commit`, `post-commit` etc.).
- Claude Code exposes explicit hook events and pre/post semantics around tool and stop flows.

**Implication for Ulf:** your chosen `pre.<event>` and `post.<event>` model is the right default for low surprise.

### 2) Blocking behavior must be explicit and narrow
Good systems clearly separate:

- blocking gates (can prevent progress), and
- observational hooks (cannot block).

Claude Code docs explicitly distinguish hook decisions and stop behavior; CI systems similarly separate manual gates from post-job notifications.

**Implication for Ulf:** keep per-hook `on_error` + `suspend_mode` explicit, and avoid hidden global behavior.

### 3) Deterministic ordering is preferred by operators
Systems that minimize surprise default to deterministic execution order.

- CI/docs patterns consistently emphasize explicit stage/dependency ordering.
- Parallelism is usually opt-in and guarded.

**Implication for Ulf:** your v1 choice (sequential declaration order) matches broad operator expectations.

### 4) Durable pause/suspend state beats in-memory pause flags
Robust orchestrators persist suspended state in control-plane state (resource spec/DB/object state), not just process memory.

- Argo supports suspend/resume with persisted workflow state and CLI resume.
- Prefect and similar systems enforce paused-state preconditions before resume.

**Implication for Ulf:** persist suspension state on disk (`.ulf/...`) and make resume idempotent.

### 5) Resume actions should be idempotent and policy-aware
Reliable systems use:

- state precondition checks,
- idempotent retry/no-op behavior,
- clear authorization and audit context.

- GitLab play/retry/manual controls and deployment approvals separate decision from execution.
- GitHub deployment approval APIs formalize pending→approved/rejected flows.
- Jenkins `input` step provides explicit human proceed/abort gate semantics.

**Implication for Ulf:** `ulf loops resume <id>` should check state and produce no-op success when already resumed.

### 6) Config UX patterns that reduce surprises
Recurring best practices:

- explicit modes over booleans,
- visible precedence rules,
- dry-run/validate commands,
- clear timeouts.

**Implication for Ulf:**
- keep mutation opt-in and explicit,
- provide `ulf hooks validate` pre-run,
- make timeout/output-limit first-class fields (you already chose this).

## Practical pattern mapping for Ulf v1

```

## Anti-surprise guardrails to carry into design

1. **Default deterministic execution** (already chosen).
2. **Explicit per-hook failure/suspend policy** (already chosen).
3. **JSON-only contracts with schema versioning** (aligned with your decision).
4. **Idempotent resume with clear user messaging**.
5. **Durable suspension markers with inspectable files**.
6. **Validation command integrated into preflight** (already requested).
