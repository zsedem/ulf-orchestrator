# CLI Tools System Research

## Command Structure

**File:** `crates/ulf-cli/src/main.rs:467-528`

Top-level commands:
```
ulf run | preflight | doctor | tutorial | resume | events | init | clean
ulf emit <topic> [payload]         ← event emission
ulf plan | code-task | task
ulf tools <subcommand>             ← agent-facing tools
ulf loops | hats | tui | web | bot
ulf completions
```

## `ulf tools` Namespace

**File:** `crates/ulf-cli/src/tools.rs`

Agent-facing tools grouped under `ulf tools`:
- `ulf tools memory` — persistent learning
- `ulf tools task` — work item tracking
- `ulf tools skill` — skill loading
- `ulf tools interact` — human-in-the-loop

Pattern: Each subcommand has its own module (e.g., `memory.rs`, `task_cli.rs`) with `Args` struct + `execute()` function.

## `ulf emit` Implementation

**File:** `crates/ulf-cli/src/main.rs:737-758, 2249-2317`

```rust
struct EmitArgs {
    pub topic: String,
    pub payload: String,
    pub json: bool,
    pub ts: Option<String>,
    pub file: PathBuf,       // default: .ulf/events.jsonl
}
```

Flow: Build JSON → resolve events file (`.ulf/current-events` marker) → append JSONL line.

## Tool Documentation

**Source of truth:** `crates/ulf-core/data/ulf-tools.md`
**Symlink:** `.claude/skills/ulf-tools/SKILL.md` → above file

CLAUDE.md instruction: "When adding or changing `ulf tools` subcommands, update `crates/ulf-core/data/ulf-tools.md`"

## Where `ulf wave` Would Fit

### Option A: Top-level command (`ulf wave`)
- Consistent with `ulf emit`, `ulf hats`, `ulf loops`
- More discoverable for users
- Best if wave management is both user-facing and agent-facing

### Option B: Under tools (`ulf tools wave`)
- Consistent with agent-facing tool pattern (memory, task, skill)
- Groups all agent tools together
- Best if wave commands are primarily for agents during hat execution

### Recommendation
Given that `ulf wave start/emit/end` is called from within hat instructions (agent-facing), **Option B (`ulf tools wave`)** aligns with the pattern. However, the issue proposes `ulf wave` as top-level, which may be more intuitive for preset authors.

Consider: `ulf wave` at top level (like `ulf emit`), since both are event-related primitives used by agents. The `ulf tools` namespace is more for state management (memory, tasks).

## Implementation Pattern

New command module: `crates/ulf-cli/src/wave.rs`

```rust
pub struct WaveArgs {
    #[command(subcommand)]
    pub command: WaveCommands,
}

pub enum WaveCommands {
    Start(StartArgs),   // ulf wave start --expect N
    End(EndArgs),       // ulf wave end
    Emit(EmitArgs),     // ulf wave emit <topic> --payloads [...]
}
```

Would write wave metadata to events file alongside regular events, or to a separate `.ulf/waves.json` state file.
