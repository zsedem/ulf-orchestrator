# Preset Evaluation Summary

**Date**: 2026-01-15 (Updated)
**Evaluator**: 🧪 Preset Evaluator (Claude Agent)
**Status**: COMPLETE - All identified bugs fixed, all tests pass

## What Was Accomplished

### ✅ Blockers Resolved

1. **BUG-001: CLI Argument Mismatch** - FIXED
   - Evaluation script was passing unsupported `-a` flag to Ulf
   - Fixed by creating merged config with backend settings
   - All evaluations can now start successfully

2. **BUG-002: YAML Format Mismatch** - FIXED
   - All 13 preset files had incorrect `default_publishes` format
   - Changed from array `["event"]` to string `"event"` format
   - Config parsing now works correctly

### 🔍 Additional Issues Identified & Fixed

3. **BUG-003: Idle Timeout Too Aggressive** - RESOLVED
   - Evaluations timeout after 30s of perceived inactivity
   - Fixed in evaluate-preset.sh by setting `idle_timeout_secs: 120`

4. **BUG-008: docs.yml orphaned event** - FIXED
   - `review.revision` event had no handler
   - Fixed: writer hat now triggers on `review.revision`

5. **BUG-009: performance-optimization.yml ambiguous** - FIXED
   - profiler hat had no `default_publishes`
   - Fixed: Added `default_publishes: "baseline.measured"`

### 📊 Evaluation Progress

- **Presets Validated**: 21/21 (all parse correctly via dry-run)
- **Bugs Found**: 9 total (9 fixed)
- **Tests Passing**: 72/72 (all cargo tests pass)
- **UX Improvements Identified**: 5
- **Enhancement Ideas**: 3

## Key Findings

### What Works Well

1. **Hat Routing**: Events correctly trigger appropriate hats
2. **Hat Instructions**: Agents understand their roles clearly
3. **File Operations**: Agents successfully create files in sandbox
4. **Role Separation**: Hats stay focused on their specific responsibilities

### What Needs Improvement

1. **Event Visibility**: No real-time view of event publication
2. **Progress Indicators**: Long-running evaluations have no progress feedback
3. **Idle Detection**: Too aggressive, interrupts legitimate agent thinking time
4. **Completion Signals**: Unclear when workflow is stuck vs. progressing

## Recommendations

### Immediate (P0)

1. Fix idle timeout in evaluation script (increase to 120s or disable)
2. Add event log monitoring to show event flow in real-time
3. Verify Kiro CLI correctly writes events to `.agent/events.jsonl`

### Short-term (P1)

1. Add progress indicators to evaluation script
2. Create preset validation tool (syntax, event graph, cycles)
3. Improve preset documentation with troubleshooting guide

### Future (P2)

1. Build preset testing framework with unit/integration tests
2. Create preset development tools (builder, visualizer)
3. Add observability features (event flow diagrams, timelines)

## Files Modified

1. `tools/evaluate-preset.sh` - Fixed CLI argument handling, idle timeout
2. `presets/*.yml` (13 files) - Fixed default_publishes format
3. `presets/docs.yml` - Added `review.revision` trigger to writer hat
4. `presets/performance-optimization.yml` - Added `default_publishes` to profiler
5. `presets/COLLECTION.md` - Updated documentation
6. `tools/preset-evaluation-findings.md` - Comprehensive findings document
7. `.agent/preset-eval-scratchpad.md` - Session tracking

## Architecture Clarification

The 21 presets are organized into two categories:

### Standalone Presets (16 presets)
Have `starting_event` in `event_loop` config - Ulf auto-publishes this event to start the workflow:
- `tdd-red-green`, `adversarial-review`, `socratic-learning`, `spec-driven`
- `mob-programming`, `scientific-method`, `code-archaeology`, `performance-optimization`
- `api-design`, `documentation-first`, `incident-response`, `migration-safety`
- `research`, `review`, `debug`, `gap-analysis`

### Planner-Dependent Presets (5 presets)
Require Ulf's internal Planner component to inject events:
- `feature`, `feature-minimal`, `deploy`, `docs`, `refactor`

This is BY DESIGN - these presets work with Ulf's planning system which creates tasks and injects `build.task` or similar events.

## Next Steps

1. ~~Apply BUG-003 fix~~ DONE
2. ~~Complete validation of all presets~~ DONE (all 21 parse correctly)
3. Consider creating a `ulf validate-preset` subcommand
4. Update preset documentation to clarify standalone vs Planner-dependent
